# GitHub‑Discord‑Bot

Work in progress

**A lightweight Discord bot that integrates GitHub activity into your Discord server.**

---

## Features

- Monitor GitHub repositories for activity (commits, issues, pull requests)
- Send automatic updates to a Discord channel or webhook
- Slash commands or text commands to fetch:
  - Current issues status
  - Recent pull requests
  - Latest commits

> _Note: Customize this section based on the actual commands implemented in `index.js`._

---

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 14.x
- A valid Discord bot token (`DISCORD_TOKEN`)
- A Discord channel or webhook for posting updates
- Optional: GitHub token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) for extended API access

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Callouu/github-discord-bot.git
cd github-discord-bot
npm install
```

Then, create a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token (optional)
WEBHOOK_URL=your_discord_webhook_url (or set up channel ID)
```

## Usage

To start the bot:

```bash
node index.js
```

Once online, the bot will monitor the configured GitHub repositories and post updates in the designated Discord channel.

You can use bot commands like:

- `!status issues user/repo` → show open issues
- `!status prs user/repo` → list active pull requests
- `!recent commits user/repo` → display latest commits

> _Customize these based on what’s actually implemented._

## Production Deployment

You can deploy this bot on any server or cloud service (Heroku, VPS, etc.)

Tips:
- Use a process manager like PM2 to keep the bot running
- Set up environment variables securely
- Optionally, use a scheduler to restart or monitor crashes
